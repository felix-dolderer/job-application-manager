# 🚀 Refactor: Migrate from Client/Server Architecture to Next.js

## Overview
This PR refactors the job application tracker from a separate client/server architecture to a unified Next.js 15 application with App Router, significantly improving developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before
```
├── client/          # React frontend
├── server/          # Express.js backend  
└── package.json     # Root orchestration
```

### After
```
├── src/
│   ├── app/         # Next.js App Router (pages + API routes)
│   ├── components/  # React components
│   ├── lib/         # Utilities (database, API client)
│   └── types/       # TypeScript definitions
├── public/          # Static assets
└── package.json     # Single dependency management
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Unified Codebase**: Single Next.js application instead of managing separate client/server
- **⚡ Performance**: Built-in SSR, code splitting, and optimizations
- **🔧 Developer Experience**: Hot reloading for both client and server code
- **📦 Simplified Deployment**: Single build process and deployment target
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the entire application
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design

## 🔄 Migration Details

### API Routes
- ✅ `GET /api/applications` - List applications with filtering
- ✅ `POST /api/applications` - Create new application
- ✅ `GET /api/applications/[id]` - Get specific application
- ✅ `PUT /api/applications/[id]` - Update application
- ✅ `DELETE /api/applications/[id]` - Delete application
- ✅ `GET /api/stats` - Application statistics

### Components Migrated
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Statistics overview with charts
- ✅ **Navigation**: Updated for Next.js routing
- ✅ **ApplicationForm**: Job application form
- ✅ **ApplicationList**: Applications table with filtering
- ✅ **ApplicationDetail**: Individual application view

### Database
- ✅ SQLite database migrated to `src/lib/`
- ✅ TypeScript database module
- ✅ Sample data included for testing

## 📊 Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Dependencies** | 3 package.json files | 1 package.json | Simplified |
| **Dev Servers** | 2 separate servers | 1 unified server | 50% reduction |
| **Build Process** | 2 separate builds | 1 build | Streamlined |
| **Deployment** | Multiple targets | Single target | Simplified |
| **Hot Reload** | Frontend only | Full-stack | Enhanced DX |

## 🧪 Testing

The application has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Database connection and migrations work
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Dashboard displays statistics
- ✅ Navigation works properly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling applied

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 📝 Next Steps

After merging, consider:
- [ ] Add remaining pages (`/applications`, `/applications/new`)
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Add form validation
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline
- [ ] Add tests
