## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed on your system
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd job-application-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for all components**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   This command will install dependencies for the root, server, and client.

3. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend client (port 3000) concurrently.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the servers separately:

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will run on http://localhost:5000

2. **Start the frontend client** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Client will run on http://localhost:3000

### Database Setup

The SQLite database will be automatically created when you first start the server. Sample data is included to help you get started quickly.

NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the client directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

  contact_email TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  interview_date DATE,
